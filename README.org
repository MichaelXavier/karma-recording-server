* karma-recording-server
** Overview
   A testing tool for myself that does a few things:
   1. Provides a tiny server that will accept all requests and record
      details about them.
   2. Provides a karma plugin that will manage this server during the
      karma lifecycle.
   3. Gives an HTTP API for playing back the recorded requests.

   It is actually just a sort of macro over the
   `karma-express-http-server` plugin.
** Usage
   You may find this in your =karma.conf.js=:
   #+begin_src javascript
   module.exports = function(config) {
     config.set({
       frameworks: ['recording-server'],
       // snip
       plugins: [
         // snip
         'karma-recording-server'
       ],
       recordingServer: {
         port: 4567,
         logging: true
       }
     });
   }
   #+end_src
** API
   - DELETE /requests: Clear all recorded requests.
   - DELETE /stubs: Clear all configured stubs
   - POST /stubs: Post a stubbed response for use later, in the
     following format. Note that path is compiled to a =RegExp=:
     #+begin_src json
     {
       "method": "GET",
       "path": "/foo/.*",
       "body": "buzz off"
     }
     #+end_src

   - GET /requests: Retrieve stubbed requests, in the following
     format:
     #+begin_src json
     {
       "method": "GET",
       "path": "/foo/bar",
       "requestHeaders": {"Accept": "application/json"},
       "requestBody": "full body"
     }
     #+end_src
** A Word of Caution
   This is a private package for a very specific purpose. It is going
   to be tailored to my purposes. If you want to turn this into a
   proper package, fork it and be my guest.
