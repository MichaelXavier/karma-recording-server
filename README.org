* karma-recording-server
** Overview
   A testing tool for myself that does a few things:
   1. Provides a tiny server that will accept all requests and record
      details about them.
   2. Provides a karma plugin that will manage this server during the
      karma lifecycle.
   3. Gives an HTTP API for playing back the recorded requests.
** A Word of Caution
   This is a private package for a very specific purpose. It is going
   to be tailored to my purposes. If you want to turn this into a
   proper package, fork it and be my guest.
